Let n denote the nth door
For each factor of n, door n is toggled. Factors include n and 1 also.
By pairing factors, one for open and other for closed, if there is odd number then door n will be open.
If n is a perfect square, then the number of factors is odd.
Between 1 to 100 we have 10 perfect squares.
Hence, there will be 10 open lockers after the procedure.
