*Referred to book solution
Let there be n people on the island and let c people have blue eyes.
we assume that c is always greater than 0.
There has to be at least one person with blue eyes

Case c=1,
The person with blue eyes, looks at all the other people's eyes and sees that none of them have blue eyes.
Since, there is at least one person with blue eyes and everyone knows of this fact, the person with blue eyes will come to know that he/she indeed has blue eyes by looking at every other person's eyes.
Hence, the person will leave the same night.

Case c=2,
The 2 people with blue eyes see each other and now are unsure whether they themselves have blue eyes or not. 
If none of them leaves the first night, then the other can conclude that he/she also has blue eyes and must also leave the island.
Hence, they leave on the second night.

Case c=k > 2 (generalizing),
When there are more than 2 people with blue eyes a similar logic applies. The blue eyed people will leave on the kth night after waiting to check for k-1 nights whether even they have blue eyes or not.

Hence, it will take c nights for c blue eyed people to leave the island.
