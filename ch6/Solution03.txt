In an 8 x 8 chessboard, we have 64 squares.
There are 32 white and 32 black squares.
If the 2 diagonally opposite corner squares are removed, we now are left with 62 squares.
the 2 diagonally opposite corner squares are of the same color.
Let the squares that were removed be of color black, then we now have 30 black squares and 32 white squares on the board.
The domino can cover to adjacent squares. Hence, for the 31 dominos to cover the modified chess board, equal number of black and white squares are needed.
i.e. 31 white and 31 black squares.
but in our case number of black squares < number of white squares.
Hence, we won't be able to cover the modified chess board.
