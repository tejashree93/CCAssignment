We can do this by approaching the test as a binary indicator of positive or negative test for poisoned bottles of soda.
Since there are 1000 keys and only 10 test strips, we need to figure out a way to map the 1000bottles to 10strips at a time.
Let all bottles be numbered and let us consider the binary representation of these numbers as bottle identifiers.
If there's a 1 in the ith bit position of the identifer of a bottle, then we add a drop to the ith strip. 
We can thus carry out the test for 2^10 = 1024 bottles of soda.

After waiting for 7days we read the results,there will be strips i with a positive test for poison. Enter 1 in the ith bit positions and determine the id of the bottle by looking at the test results of all test strips.
