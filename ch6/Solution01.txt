Take different number of pills from each of the 20 bottles.
1 pill from Bottle1, 2 pills from Bottle2 and so on till 20 pills from Bottle20
If all pills had a weight of 1gram then, total weight = n*(n+1)/2 where n is the number of pills on the scale.
The actual weight on the scale will be greater than the expected total weight when all pills would have been 1gram.
Hence, we will come to know which bottle contributed to the 0.1 gram pills by using the following formula:
(actual weight - expected weight)/0.1
expected weight = 20*(20+1)/2 = 210
