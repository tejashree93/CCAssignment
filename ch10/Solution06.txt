The file size is 20GB and each string is situated on a different line.
It is not possible to load the entire file into the memory for sorting.
We need to divide the file into separate chunks.
The individual chunks can be sorted using any of the sorts e.g. bubble, insert, selection, quick, merge
This depends on the requirement of running time and space complexity.
If individual sub-chunks of the file are processed in parallel, then the computing can become faster.
Once all the sub chunks are sorted, pairs of those chunks can be merged and sorted using merge sort.
This complete process is called external sort.  // as explained by Prof. Ralf in Tuesday's lecture.
